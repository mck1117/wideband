## Building Firmware

The `firmware/boards` directory contains configuration for each board this firmware supports.

For the standalone board and the module built in to rusEFI Hellen boards, `f0_module` is the correct target.  Use the `build_wideband.sh` script to build and package the wideband firmware: both a bin including the bootloader, and a header file consumed by rusEFI that contains no bootloader, to be uploaded over CAN (via the aforementioned bootloader).
